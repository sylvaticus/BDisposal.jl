The nature of the DMUs (eg. firms, countries etc.) depends on the aim of the environmental efficiency analysis. All the DMUs are characterized by a set of inputs and outputs separated into undesirable (eg., polluting) and desirable (eg., no polluting) ones. Note that, inputs separation into desirable (eg., non emissions-causing) and undesirable (eg., emissions-causing) compo- nents is optional for the BDisposal package. The BDisposal DEA modelling defines the smallest environmental production process that contains all DMUs informations (in- puts/outputs) and satisfies the B-disposal axiomatic pattern. The BDisposal algorithms for efficiency assessment compute the distance to the best environmental production procedures; ie., to the efficient production frontier. These efficiency indices inherit the structure of additive and multiplicative distance functions. Notice that the BDisposal package computes general shape of additive and multiplicative distance functions. It follows that, the Bdisposal package introduces a flexible framework for environmental efficiency as- sessment, with the possibility to analyse different directions for the distance functions. In addition, the BDisposal package allows to test the (economists’) properties of con- vexity and disposability.\n\nInterpretation of the results\n\nEfficiency indicators\n\nWhen the additive shape of the distance function is greater than 0 then, the produc- tion unit doesn’t operate efficiently. If the additive efficiency score is equal to 0 then, the DMU is efficient. It follows that, the DMU employs one of the best production technology to transform inputs into outputs; ie., the producer is a benchmark for the other observations. A similar reasoning holds for the multiplicative distance functions. If the multiplicative efficiency index is greater than 1 then, the DMU doesn’t perform efficiently. When the multiplicative efficiency score is equal to 1 then, the production unit is a benchmark for the other observations.\n\nConvexity test\n\nWhen the multiplicative test of convexity is greater than 1 (respectively, equal to 1) then, the production process frontier is non convex (respec- tively, convex). If the multiplicative test of disposability is greater than 1 (respectively, equal to 1) then, the frontier of the production set displays B-disposability; ie., there exists costs for undesirable component decrease. A similar reasoning applies for the additive framework. The informations provided by these tests define the shape of the production process boundaries.\n\nNotes:\n\nOnly the static efficiency analysis is implemented at the moment\nThe non-convex problem still need to consider bad inputs, consider directions, consider multiplicative/additive structures\nDirections toward where to measure the efficiency distance can be tuned using the dirGI,dirBI,dirGO and dirBO parameters. For example:\nTo measure the distance toward \"bad outputs\": use (0,0,1,-1)\n...

These productivity measures are implemented for different time periods (eg., years, months etc.) or spatial units (eg., countries, cities etc.), based on the  environmental efficiency indicators described in efficiencyScores. Hence, the environmental productivity indices inherit the structure of additive and multiplicative productivity measures.\n\nInterpretation of the results\n\nThe additive productivity indicator shows combined desirable and undesirable outputs productivity improvement (respectively decline) when it takes positive (respectively negative) values. In the multiplicative context, if the productivity measure is greater (respectively lesser) than 1 then, desirable and undesirable outputs productivity increase (respectively decrease) arises. The BDisposal package underscores the prominent sources of environmental productivity change. The main drivers of productivity variation are technological change, technical efficiency variation and scale efficiency change. For the additive background, when the technological change is greater (respectively, lesser) than 0 then, technolog- ical improvement (respectively, deterioration) occurs. A similar reasoning applies for the additive technical and scale efficiency components. In the multiplicative context, if the technological change is greater (respectively, lesser) than 1 then, technological in- crease (respectively, decrrease) arises. A similar reasonnng applies for the multiplicative technical and scale efficiency components.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe non-convex problem still need to consider bad inputs, consider directions, consider multiplicative/additive structures\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"index.html#![BDisposalLogos](assets/BDisposal_logo_30x30.png)-BDisposal.jl-Documentation","page":"Index","title":"(Image: BDisposalLogos) BDisposal.jl Documentation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Index","title":"Index","text":"Welcome to the documentation for the Non parametric productivity analysis under the B-disposal assumption package.","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Index","title":"Index","text":"The BDisposal package proposes a serie of environmental efficiency and productivity algorithms for non-parametric modelling when we relax the disposability assumption of some of the outputs and/or inputs (e.g. pollution).
