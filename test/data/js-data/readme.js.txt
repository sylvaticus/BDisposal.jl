The data consist of two parts, oecd countries and asian countries.  Both
data come from the Penn World Tables (Mark 5.6) and the U.S. Energy

countries are extended using International Financial Statistics (IFS).  

Both files, which are ASCII files in DOS format, are zipped in the file
js-data.zip. Unix users should use "unzip -a".
